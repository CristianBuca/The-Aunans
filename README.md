## **Design**

The design of the app is consistent with other major apps that a World of Warcraft player might be already familiar with. It provides synergy with web apps like [World of Warcraft Armory](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/), [WoWProgress](https://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/darksorrow/The+Aunans), [Raider IO](https://raider.io) and [Warcraft Logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com) while funneling information relevant to the site owner's to the user.
The dark tone with high contrasts was chosen to cater to gamers who by default will gravitate to "night-mode" options on apps as they will usually avoid bright areas due to reflections in their displays while gaming.

The app is fully responsive to different devices and information is contextualised based on screen sizes. On small devices, overload of visual data is avoided by hiding some extra details and information while keeping only the most important features. Landing Page displays only heroic achievement, Leadership Section only displays the guild leader and History Section provides brief history of the guild's early days. Secondary achievements on Guild Info Page are readuced from 6+2 achievements on large screens to 4+3 on medium screens to 2 on small screens. On larger devices aditional content populates it's features like a comic strip on Landing Page and aditional Achievemnt banners; Guild Info Page shows First Officer's avatar also and History Section will have further breakdown of the guild's past for every game expansion.

Sections on all pages were implemented using Bootrap grid thus columns re-arrange based on the width of the device the user is using to maximise the use of screen realty and provide a better user experience.

### **Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme is based on The Aunans' banner colours and the colours representive of the faction they belong to.

![Colour scheme sample](https://github.com/CristianBuca/The-Aunans/blob/main/docs/aunans-color-scheme.png)

#0E174F
#163E88
#BA0C0C
#D79717
#FFC107

### **Font Scheme**

Open Sans and Roboto sans-serif based font families were used to maintain the tone of the game's website.

# **Scope**

## Feature requirements:

* Responsive website for all devices.
* Navigation bar that collapses on small devices
* A Landing Page that will provide the main target information to the user trough suggestive images and cross-connections to other World of Warcraft content.
* A Call to Arms to incentivise users to apply for membership.
* A modal for the application form.
* Display of the team's achievements.
* An activity schedule.
* Guild's Leadership and History presentation.
* Member's roster presentation.
* Links and references to game guides tailored to guild's focus.
* Gallery of images and videos submitted by current members.
* A customised 404 Error Page to enable the user to turn back without leaving our domain.
